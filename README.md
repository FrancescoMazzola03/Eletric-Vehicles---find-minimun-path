# Eletric-Vehicles---find-minimun-path

During my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering, I developed a project in C focused on optimizing vehicle travel routes along a highway, represented as a series of service stations. Each service station was placed at a unique distance from the start of the highway and housed a fleet of electric vehicles, each with a defined driving range. The challenge was to compute the shortest path between two stations, adhering to the vehicle range constraints, while minimizing the number of stops.
The program allowed for dynamic updates to the system, such as adding or removing stations, managing vehicle fleets, and calculating optimal travel routes. The core objective was to ensure the shortest possible route between any two stations, prioritizing paths that minimized travel distance from the start of the highway in cases of equal number of stops. The project required handling complex conditions such as only moving forward between stations and renting new vehicles at each stop.
The complexity of the problem lay in its constraints and efficiency requirements. The input file was around 30MB, containing approximately 260 000 lines of commands, and my program was able to process the entire file and compute results in just 2-3 seconds. This focus on time and space efficiency was crucial, as the project was evaluated based on these metrics.
This experience allowed me to further refine my programming and problem-solving skills, particularly in C, while dealing with real-world constraints on performance and data processing. I’m proud to say that I received full marks for this project.
